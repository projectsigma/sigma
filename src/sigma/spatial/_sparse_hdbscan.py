"""HDBSCAN* on a sparse, truncated distance graph with weighted positions.

Why this module exists
----------------------
scikit-learn's ``HDBSCAN(metric="precomputed")`` accepts a sparse distance
matrix only if every row stores at least ``min_samples`` neighbours and the
graph is connected. A network-distance graph truncated at ``max_distance``
satisfies neither condition in general (isolated observations, islands,
disconnected network pieces). This module implements the same algorithm
(Campello, Moulavi and Sander 2013; McInnes, Healy and Astels 2017) directly
on such a graph.

Conventions follow scikit-learn so that results can be compared:

* ``min_samples`` counts the observation itself;
* lambda = 1 / distance, and lambda = inf for distance 0;
* the Excess-of-Mass rule selects a cluster when its stability is at least
  the summed stability of its selected descendants;
* ``cluster_selection_epsilon``, ``max_cluster_size`` and
  ``allow_single_cluster`` have scikit-learn's meaning.

Equal mutual-reachability distances are the one deliberate hierarchy-level
choice. They are processed simultaneously as a multifurcation. A binary MST
implementation has to order tied edges somehow, and that arbitrary order can
change zero-lifetime intermediate groups and, in turn, selected clusters. The
simultaneous rule makes the result invariant to row order and point-ID naming;
it can therefore differ from scikit-learn in tie-heavy cases.

Algorithmic lineage
-------------------
The clustering model is HDBSCAN*: Campello, Moulavi & Sander (2013),
https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-37456-2_14, and Campello et al. (2015),
https://doi.org/10.1145/2733381.  Stability-based extraction follows Campello
et al. (2013), https://doi.org/10.1007/s10618-013-0311-4; the minimum-spanning-
tree/single-linkage connection follows Gower & Ross (1969).  API conventions
are comparable to McInnes, Healy & Astels (2017),
https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.00205, and scikit-learn.  Sparse truncation,
validation, deterministic simultaneous tie handling, and weighted-position
compression are implementation/engineering choices; they do not claim a new
clustering objective.

Two extensions:

1. Weighted positions. Observations at one snapped position have distance 0
   to each other. They are represented once, with a weight equal to their
   count. A position with weight ``w`` behaves as ``w`` identical points:
   they stay together until the distance equals the position's core
   distance, where all of them leave their cluster at once.
2. Disconnected graphs. Pairs farther apart than ``max_distance`` (or on
   disconnected network components) are treated as infinitely far apart. The
   minimum spanning tree becomes a forest, and all forest components hang
   from one root at lambda = 0.
